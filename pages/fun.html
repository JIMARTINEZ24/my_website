                <h2>Here's how Yoshi enjoys her time:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Playing Fetch:</strong> Yoshi loves to chase after balls or toys. Her high energy and
                        agility make fetch a fantastic way for her to have fun.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exploring Outdoors:</strong> Yoshi thrives on walks, hikes, and exploring new
                        environments.
                        Her curious nature means she enjoys sniffing around and discovering new scents.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interactive Toys:</strong> Puzzle toys or treat-dispensing toys keep Yoshi's mind
                        engaged.
                        She enjoys figuring out how to get to the treats hidden inside.</li>
                    <li><strong>Agility Training:</strong> Yoshi excels in agility courses. Running through tunnels,
                        jumping
                        over hurdles, and weaving between poles challenge and entertain her.</li>
                    <li><strong>Training Sessions:</strong> Yoshi is intelligent and responsive to training. Short,
                        positive
                        reinforcement-based sessions are both fun and rewarding for her.</li>
                    <li><strong>Playdates with Other Dogs:</strong> Social interaction with other dogs can be a blast
                        for
                        Yoshi, especially if they have compatible play styles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tug-of-War:</strong> Yoshi enjoys a good game of tug-of-war with her owners. It's a
                        great
                        way for her to burn off energy and strengthen the bond with her family.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chasing Squirrels or Birds:</strong> With her strong prey drive, Yoshi might get a kick
                        out
                        of the occasional chase. Always ensure she's in a safe, secure area during these escapades.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exploring New Toys:</strong> Introducing new toys or rotating her current toys keeps
                        things
                        exciting and prevents boredom for Yoshi.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cuddling and Relaxing:</strong> After all her energetic activities, Yoshi also enjoys
                        curling up with her favorite people for some relaxation and affection.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Here are some things Yoshi might not enjoy:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Being Left Alone for Long Periods:</strong> Yoshi doesn't like being alone for too long.
                        She
                        prefers having her people around or engaging in activities that keep her stimulated.</li>
                    <li><strong>Excessive Rain or Bad Weather:</strong> Yoshi isn't fond of getting wet or being outside
                        in
                        heavy rain or extreme weather. She might resist going outside when the weather is unfavorable.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Being Forced into Situations:</strong> Yoshi values her independence and doesn't
                        appreciate
                        being forced into situations or activities she's uncomfortable with, like being picked up
                        against
                        her will.</li>
                    <li><strong>Overly Repetitive Training Sessions:</strong> Although Yoshi is intelligent, she can get
                        bored with repetitive training exercises. She prefers training that is engaging and varied.</li>
                    <li><strong>Being Ignored:</strong> Yoshi enjoys interaction and engagement. If she feels ignored or
                        neglected, she might act out or become aloof.</li>
                    <li><strong>Loud or Abrupt Noises:</strong> Yoshi can be sensitive to loud noises or sudden sounds,
                        which might startle her or cause her stress.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sharing Attention:</strong> Yoshi can be somewhat aloof and may not enjoy sharing her
                        human's attention with other pets or people, especially if she's used to being the center of
                        attention.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unfamiliar People or Animals:</strong> Yoshi may be reserved or cautious around
                        unfamiliar
                        people or animals until she feels comfortable. She might need some time to warm up to new
                        acquaintances.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prolonged Confinement:</strong> Being in a confined space for extended periods can be
                        frustrating for Yoshi. She needs space to roam and explore.</li>
                    <li><strong>Excessive Physical Contact:</strong> While Yoshi can be affectionate, she generally
                        doesn't
                        enjoy being overly cuddled or restrained. She appreciates her personal space and can be
                        particular
                        about physical contact.</li>
